  # first steps

    * install some apms: newrelic, strongops
      > github.com/lloyd/node-toobusy

  ## important
      * apms hurt your performance

      * either:
          1. have a staging environment to test against
          2. install these tools in one of your servers
             under the load-balancer, and make the tests
             hit that server
