  # first steps

    * install some apms: newrelic, strongops
      (also see github.com/lloyd/node-toobusy)

  ## important

      * apms hurt your performance
        this is not up for debate people, we always remove it
        to benchmark cause it does show up

      * either:
          1. have a staging environment to test against
          2. install these tools in one of your servers
             under the load-balancer, and make the tests
             hit that server
