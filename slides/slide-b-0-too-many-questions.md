    * they are ashamed of what they did (refactoring)
    * they are afraid of security flaws
    * npm was super powerful, but i need to
      make sure i control the code that gets shipped
    * how do i deploy integrating in my tool-chain
      and infrastructure?
    * iz it truly web-scale sauce?
