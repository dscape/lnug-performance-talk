  # First Steps

    * Install NewRelic, StrongOps

    ## Important

      * Both StrongOps and NewRelic hurt your performance

        Ideally make sure you either:
          1. Have a staging environment to test against
          2. Install these tools in one of your servers
             under the balancer, and make the tests
             hit that server
